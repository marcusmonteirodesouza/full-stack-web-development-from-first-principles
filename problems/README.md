# Problems

## Hypothesis

Is a hypothesis about how we are going to grow quickly. How do we prove it?

## Problem

Should be:

* Popular
* Growing
* Urgent
* Expensive
* Mandatory
* Frequent (a lot of opportunities do convert)

* Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Trigger

Ideally:

* 1M+ people have it
* Growing 20%/year
* Happening right now
* People spend $Billions trying to solve it
* Some Law Changed that enabled novel solution
* People face it hourly

## Solution

Don't start here

Do not SISP (Solution is Search of a Problem)

## Insight

What is your unfair advantage? You need one

It must be related to growth

* Founders (rarest kind. The founders must be REALLY unique for this to be considered a real advantage)
* Market growing 20%/year (one of weakest. All ships rise with the tide)
* Product 10x (orders of magnitude) better than what we had previously (makes customers go "oh shit!")
* Acquistion costs $0 (it can and does grow via word of mouth)
* Has Monopoly characteristics (effects that get stronger with growth. Example: network effects)

## Threshold

Can you build it?

## Sales

Can you sell?

## MVP

* Launch something bad quickly
* Get initial customers (anyone interacting with the product)
* Talk to users, get feedback
* Iterate
* Weeks, not months
* Very limited functionality
* Strongly appeal to small set of users
* Launch means to start getting customers

Spec: 
* Time box it
* Write it
* Cut it
* Don't fall in love with the mvp

## How to talk to users

The Mom Test, 3 common errors:

1. Talk about the idea. It is not to sell but to extract information
2. Talk specifics, not hypotheticals (life in general)
3. Listen, don't talk

Five questions:
1. Hardest part of doing the thing you want to solve
2. Tell me about the last time that you encountered that problem
3. Why was that hard? Customers don't buy the what, they buy the why
4. What, if anything, have you tried to solve this problem?
5. What don't you love about the solutions that you already tried?

Got idea? 

* Find users with problem:
  * Friends, coworkers, intros
  * Drop by in person!
  * Industry events

  * Take notes (capture as much information as possible)
  * Keep it casual
  * Be kind with their time


Built prototype?

* Find **best** first customer
  * Numerical answers
  * How much does this problem cost them today?
  * How frequent is the problem? (most frequently is best)
  * How large is their budget?


Launched?

* Find product-market fit
  
  * How would you feel if you could no longer use our product? Measure the 'very disappointed' answer. PMF happens when 'very disappoint' > 40%
  * Ask for phone number during sign up (talk)
  * Don't design by committee
  * Discard bad data

## How to launch (again and again)

Silent Launch

* Domain Name
*  Company Name
* Short Description
*  Contact
* Call to Action

Friends and Family

* As soon as possible

Launch to Strangers

* lugg example

## KPIs and Goals

Primary metric (only one):

  * Revenue (recurring revenue is best) or Active Users
  * Represents delivery of real value? (revenue is best)
  * Captures recurring value?
  * Lagging indicator? (must already have occurred)
  * Usable feedback mechanism? (helps prioritize)


Secondary metrics:
